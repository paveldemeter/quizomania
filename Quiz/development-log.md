First update: After writing some code, I first wanted the design of the application to stand out extensively to attract more target audience. I then decided to just include two gem which are Colorize & Ascii for a basic design due to reading the assessment and realising I need to spend my time on other important issues that require my attention.

Second update: After a test run of the basic code, I changed the 'Genre' feature from 5 Genre's to 3 as I didn't want it to be over flowing and seem too extreme, My opinion is 3 Genre's is adequate for the user to be able to choose from, In the future I would like to include an update which will add SubGenre's such as "Rock Music", "2000's Movies" or "War History".

### 4/09/19
Third update: After basic debugging the application handles adequately, but still needs some tweaks. I have changed the 'Score' feature from outputting the score & the wrong answers you have entered in, to just outputting the score.

My opinion is that this way the user can return to the main menu, retry the genre again and figure out on their own which answer was incorrect. (Makes the game a little bit more challenging)
